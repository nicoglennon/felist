# Felist ðŸ˜¸
Check out the latest deployment of Felist [here](https://feli.st).

I built Felist to finally have a simple, interactive organizer that was not a complete overkill. Hope you find it easy and useful too.

Backlog as of May 31st, 2019:
- Drag-and-drop items to another list.
- Color schemes & CSS options (in a settings button).
- Parse text for websites and auto-generate a-tags (links).
- Mobile-friendly.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
