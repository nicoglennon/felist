# Felist
Find Felist on Heroku [here](https://felist.herokuapp.com).

I built Felist to finally have a simple, interactive organizer that was not a complete overkill. Hope you find it easy and useful too.

Backlog as of Apr 1, 2018:
- drag-and-drop to move items around the same list / to other lists.
- color schemes & CSS options (in a settings button).
- Parse text for websites and auto-generate a-tags (links).
- move away from localStorage in front end and actually use a backend login/password.
- mobile-friendly.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
