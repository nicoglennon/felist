# Felix
Find felix on heroku [here](https://felixlist.herokuapp.com).

I built felix to finally have a simple, interactive todolist that is not a complete overkill. Hope you find it easy and useful too.

Backlog as of Feb 1, 2018:
- delete a list (core feature).
- Parse text for websites and auto-generate a-tags (links).
- color schemes & CSS options (in a settings button).
- drag-and-drop to move items around the same list / to other lists.
- mobile-friendly.
- fix bug of two lists with same name syncing.
- move away from localStorage and actually use a backend with login/password.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
